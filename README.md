This page is a loose copy of https://www.microverse.org/.

I borrowed the navbar technique of logo on one side and site menu on the other, with a separately styled button to join.
Next, I copied the header section with a tag line and call to action button. I chose to do a full background image on this section, however, to satisfy the assignment requirements.
I also copied the side-by-side highlights but used icons instead of images in the first of these two sections.
Finally, I copied the email call to action section.

My site obviously does not look exactly like the Microverse site, but it borrows heavily from the structure.
I could not copy a lot of the background art because Microverse used their own SVGs for these.
I thought the navbar and side-by-side highlights collapsed nicely, switching from rows to columns.
The images also resized well in the third section, while I had to code in the resizing for the cover photo.
